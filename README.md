## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict IMDb **movie ratings** based on various movie attributes, including genre, director, actors, year, duration, and votes. The project follows a structured approach of data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation to achieve an optimized prediction model.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about movies and their ratings, with key features such as:

- **Genre** (Categorical)
- **Director** (Categorical)
- **Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3** (Categorical)
- **Year** (Numerical)
- **Duration** (Numerical - in minutes)
- **Votes** (Numerical - total votes)
- **Rating** (Numerical - Target Variable)

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes multiple preprocessing steps, including:

- **Encoding detection** for proper file reading
- **Handling missing values** (dropping missing target values, imputing categorical and numerical features)
- **Converting string-based numerical features** (e.g., converting "Votes" to float, extracting numeric duration)
- **Removing duplicates**
- **Feature scaling** (StandardScaler for numerical features)
- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features

## Feature Engineering

- Encoding categorical variables using **OneHotEncoder**
- Filling missing numerical values with **median imputation**
- Standardizing numerical features

## Models Implemented

The project uses multiple regression models, with a focus on **Random Forest Regression**. The workflow includes:

1. **Baseline Model**: Standard **Random Forest Regressor**
2. **Improved Model with Feature Engineering**
3. **Pipeline Implementation**: Combining preprocessing and modeling steps

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To improve model performance, **GridSearchCV** is used for hyperparameter tuning. The key parameters optimized include:

- **n_estimators**: [100, 200, 300]
- **max_depth**: [None, 10, 20, 30]
- **min_samples_split**: [2, 5, 10]
- **min_samples_leaf**: [1, 2, 4]

## Performance Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared Score (RÂ²)**

The final optimized model achieved **higher accuracy and lower error rates**, indicating effective prediction of IMDb ratings.
